## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam and I'm a Computer Science student at University of Warmia-Masuria.

I'm currently working on custom SCRUM web app for [DBK group](https://grupadbk.com/) as part of group project led by UWM. I'm also taking part in creating a clinic's support system, which will be finished on the 5th June.

I'm currently learning React for group project use, and Spring Boot for Cloud and REST API for my next project in the near future.


### Hobbies

- Currently I'm mainly fascinated with martial arts, especially Muay Thai at the moment but it will take me some time to achieve some profesionalism.
