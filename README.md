## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam and I'm a Computer Science student at University of Warmia-Masuria.

I'm currently working on e-commerce web app for my Bachelor Thesis.

I'm currently learning React for completing Bachelor Thesis.


### Hobbies

- Currently I'm mainly fascinated with martial arts, especially Muay Thai at the moment but it will take me some time to achieve some profesionalism.
